# Eurotherm3504
3504 Eurotherm power supply automation via LabVIEW.
Developed LabVIEW software to control and monitor evaporator temperature using MODBUS communication. The program gradually ramps temperature to prevent filament damage, holds at target for deposition, then cools down safely. Communication was established via VISA over a USB-to-DB9 serial connection. Adapted from Eurotherm base code for custom lab use.
